A GitHub Action that fetches your top albums from [stats.fm](https://stats.fm/) (formerly Spotistats) for a specified time range and displays them as linked images with tooltips on your GitHub profile README. Inspired by the [lastfm-to-markdown](https://github.com/lastfm-to-markdown/lastfm-to-markdown) project.

---

## ‚ú® Example Output Section

This action will find the following markers in your README file and automatically insert the generated list of your top albums between them:

<!-- STATSFM START -->

<!-- STATSFM END -->

*(The actual content generated by the workflow will appear between these markers, displaying linked album covers. Hovering over an image will show a tooltip with the artist, album title, and optionally the rank and playtime, if configured.)*

## üöÄ Usage

Follow these steps to set up the action:

1.  **Add Markers to your README:**
    Add the following comment markers to your `README.md` file where you want the stats.fm top albums section to appear. The content between these markers will be automatically generated and updated by the action.

    ```markdown
    <!-- STATSFM START -->
    <!-- STATSFM END -->
    ```

2.  **Create a Workflow File:**
    Create a new file in your repository at the path `.github/workflows/statsfm.yml` (or choose a different name). Paste the following YAML content into the file:

    ```yaml
    name: Update stats.fm Top Albums

    on:
      # Schedule updates (e.g., runs every day at midnight UTC)
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'
      # Allow manual triggering
      workflow_dispatch:

    jobs:
      update-readme:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
          contents: write # Required to push changes back to the repository
        steps:
          # Check out the repository code
          - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v4

          # Run the statsfm-to-markdown action
          - name: Update stats.fm top albums
            uses: teraha-dev/statsfm-to-markdown@v1.0.0 # Use the latest release tag (e.g., @v1.0.0)
            with:
              # REQUIRED: Your stats.fm username
              statsfm_username: 'YOUR_STATSFM_USERNAME' # Replace with your actual username

              # OPTIONAL: Customize the display (see Inputs below)
              display_limit: '10'        # Number of albums to show (max 50)
              time_range: 'weeks'       # Data period: weeks, months, lifetime
              show_rank: 'true'         # Include rank number in tooltip: true, false
              show_duration: 'true'     # Include playtime in tooltip: true, false
              readme_path: 'README.md'  # Path to your README file

          # Commit and push the updated README file
          - name: Commit and push changes
            run: |
              git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
              git config --local user.name "statsfm-to-markdown Action"
              git add README.md # Or use the specific path from 'readme_path' if changed
              # Commit only if README.md has changed
              if git diff --staged --quiet; then
                echo "No changes in README.md. Skipping commit."
              else
                git commit -m "docs: Update stats.fm top albums"
                echo "Pushing changes..."
                git push
              fi
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Required for pushing changes
    ```

3.  **Replace Placeholders:**
    *   In the workflow file (`.github/workflows/statsfm.yml`), find the line `statsfm_username: 'YOUR_STATSFM_USERNAME'` and replace `'YOUR_STATSFM_USERNAME'` with your actual stats.fm username.

4.  **Commit and Push:**
    Commit the new workflow file (`.github/workflows/statsfm.yml`) and your updated `README.md` (containing the markers) to your repository's main branch.

The action will now run according to the schedule you defined (`cron`) or when you manually trigger it from the Actions tab in your GitHub repository.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Inputs

The following inputs can be configured using the `with` keyword in your workflow file:

| Input             | Description                                                         | Required | Default    | Options                     |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- |
| `statsfm_username`| Your username on stats.fm.                                          | **`true`** | `N/A`      |                             |
| `display_limit`   | The maximum number of albums to display.                            | `false`  | `10`       | `1` to `50`                 |
| `show_duration`   | Whether to include the total playtime in the image tooltip.           | `false`  | `true`     | `true`, `false`             |
| `show_rank`       | Whether to include the ranking number (#1, #2...) in the image tooltip. | `false`  | `true`     | `true`, `false`             |
| `time_range`      | The time period for fetching top albums data.                       | `false`  | `weeks`    | `weeks`, `months`, `lifetime` |
| `readme_path`     | The path to the README file that needs to be updated.               | `false`  | `README.md`|                             |

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Examples

**Basic Setup (Default Settings):**
Shows the top 10 albums from the last few weeks. Tooltips will include rank and duration.

```yaml
- name: Update stats.fm top albums
  uses: teraha-dev/statsfm-to-markdown@v1.0.0
  with:
    statsfm_username: 'your_username'
```

**Customized Setup (Top 5 Albums, Lifetime, No Rank/Duration in Tooltip):**
Shows the top 5 albums from all time, hiding the rank and duration in the tooltips.

```yaml
- name: Update stats.fm top albums
  uses: teraha-dev/statsfm-to-markdown@v1.0.0
  with:
    statsfm_username: 'your_username'
    display_limit: '5'
    time_range: 'lifetime'
    show_rank: 'false'
    show_duration: 'false'
```

**Updating a Different File:**
Updates a file named `PROFILE.md` instead of the default `README.md`.

```yaml
- name: Update stats.fm top albums in PROFILE.md
  uses: teraha-dev/statsfm-to-markdown@v1.0.0
  with:
    statsfm_username: 'your_username'
    readme_path: 'PROFILE.md' # Don't forget to add the markers in PROFILE.md too!
```

## ü§î Troubleshooting

*   **Workflow Not Running:** Ensure the workflow file (`.github/workflows/statsfm.yml`) is correctly placed in the `.github/workflows/` directory and has been pushed to your default branch (usually `main` or `master`). Check the Actions tab in your repository for run logs.
*   **Markers Not Found Error:** Double-check that `<!-- STATSFM START -->` and `<!-- STATSFM END -->` markers exist exactly as shown (case-sensitive) on separate lines within your `README.md` file (or the file specified in `readme_path`). The START marker must appear before the END marker. Ensure there are blank lines before the START marker and after the END marker if they are near other content.
*   **Invalid Username Error:** Verify that the `statsfm_username` provided in the workflow file is your correct stats.fm username.
*   **API Errors / No Albums Displayed:**
    *   The stats.fm API might be temporarily unavailable. Check the workflow logs for specific error messages (like HTTP status codes).
    *   Ensure you have listening history on stats.fm for the selected `time_range`. If `time_range` is `weeks` or `months`, you need recent plays.
    *   The action filters out albums if they lack essential data from the API (e.g., image URL). Try increasing the `display_limit` slightly, as the API might return items that cannot be displayed.
    *   **Note:** This action relies on stats.fm's public-facing interfaces which could change without notice, potentially affecting the action's stability or causing errors.
*   **Changes Not Committed/Pushed:**
    *   Ensure the `permissions: contents: write` line is present in your workflow job configuration, as shown in the usage example.
    *   Ensure the `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` line is present in the commit step's environment variables.
    *   Verify your repository settings (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions) allow Actions to create commits/pull requests if you have specific branch protection rules that might interfere.
